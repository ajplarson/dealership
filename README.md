# dealership
Developed by Andrew Larson
Dealership web application for Dev10 Capstone Project

I employed the following technologies:
 - Java with Spring Boot for handling the backend
 - Spring MVC for Architecture
 - Spring Security 
 - MySQL for Database ~13 DAOS for the whole dealership
 - Java Database Connectivity Template for Managing database entities (JDBC Template)
 - Thymeleaf for Serverside rendering of HTML 
 - CSS 3 for general styling
 - jQuery for AJAX vehicle inventory search
 - JS for dynamic generation of HTML for database entities 
 
 The project is representing a fictitious dealership named Autos by Andrew. There is a landing page with a carousel detailing the specials and a display of all featured vehicles. From the navbar, you can select a used or new inventory which displays all new and used vehicles. You are also able to search by make, model, year, and/or price. In addition, there is an admin page used to create new vehicles, users etc. I ran out of time in the 2 weeks we had to implement the edit functionality for these features but I am overall happy with the way things are. Feel free to DM/email for more specificity
